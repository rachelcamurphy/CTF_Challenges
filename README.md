# CTF_Challenges

A summary of the Women in Cybersecurity's Capture the Flag Challenge. 
In order to avoid giving away any flags to future participants, I will simply focus on methodology. 
There were a total of 27 levels for this challenge, and I completed 26 levels and captured 26 flags. 
I scored 45th out of 682 players, and I have to owe part of this success to the tips and hints provided in the 
community slack channel. There are some smart and sneaky cookies out there! With that being said, I was glued to
my computer for those 72 hours and went down several rabbit holes before realizing that some flags were more simple 
to capture than I thought. 

Tools Utilized:

Cyberchef, NetCat, Kali Linux, Hashcat, and GOOGLE GOOGLE GOOGLE.
